          >>var topics = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Git', 'JavaScript'];<< </li>
        <li> "for" will look at an array and fill in all topics with increments of +1 starting from 0 due to code x++ meaning +1 until all topic variations have been fulfilled. <br/>
           >> for (var x = 0; x < topics.length; x++) {
          console.log(topics[x]);
        } << </li>
        <li>without "for" loops, each part of the array would need an additional line of code (time consuming and messy) </li>
        <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
